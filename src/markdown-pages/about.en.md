#About the Project

Hello! You're here probably because you know about the difficult situation created by the COVID-19 virus. And also because of that you must be eager to find more information and solutions to protect yourself and your loved ones from this virus.

In the XXI century we have access to many technologies and digital tools that allow us to use methods of fast information propagation with the help of the Internet and social media, the constant growing of the power and processing speed of computers and their capacity of finding patterns and correlations where people can't because of big amounts of data. 

Modern technologies + a strong IT community in Moldova that is eager to find modern solutions, to study information and transform it into hundreds of lines of code have come together into a community that fights against the COVID-19 virus and this platform will help you be informed about the current situation and the new solutions found and developed by the IT community with your help and support!

Be informed, follow the rules for preventing contagion and let's make technology and computers work to solve the problems caused by the coronavirus!


##The C19.MD Open Source Initiative

The project was initiated in order to develop solutions for problems created by coronavirus in Moldova. As part of the project we'll follow closely the progress of the situation and we'll track the problems that can be solved in the context of IT Open Source and the initiatives organized by the volunteers.
