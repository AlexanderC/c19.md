#About COVID-19: Basics

[Spread History Summary](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/summary.html)


###Background

CDC is the outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel (new) coronavirus that was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Now it has spread in more than 150 locations internationally. The virus has been named “SARS-CoV-2” and the disease it causes has been named “coronavirus disease 2019” (abbreviated “COVID-19”).

###How it spreads?

Patients at the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, China had some link to seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. Person-to-person spread was subsequently reported outside Hubei and in countries outside China. Covid-19 spreads from human to human through respiratory ways and close contact.

Some people are at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness. This includes:
- Older adults, with risk increasing by age.
- People who have serious chronic medical conditions like:
- Heart disease
- Diabetes
- Lung disease

###Symptoms
The following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure.
- Fever
- Cough
- Shortness of breath

#Advanced
###Testing
*Johns Hopkins clinical microbiologists [Karen Carroll](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/results/directory/profile/0017521/karen-carroll), M.D., and [Heba Mostafa](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/results/directory/profile/10005481/heba-mostafa), M.B.B.Ch., Ph.D., have developed an in-house coronavirus screening test that may soon allow the health system to test as many as 1,000 people per day.*

###COVID-19 surface survival time
COVID-19 coronavirus can survive up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard, and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. The researchers also found that this virus can hang out as droplets in the air for up to three hours before they fall. But most often they will fall more quickly. More research is needed to identify the resistance in other circumstances as exposure to sunlight etc.

###Spread of COVID-19 during warmer months

Not yet known. Specialists do not confirm or infirm that C-19 will spread slower during warmer months. Even though common cold spreads more during colder seasons, it is not impossible to get sick during summer.

###Treatment

General Treatment:
- Isolation and bedrest with close monitoring of the patient body functions and frequent medical tests
- Oxygen Therapy
- Antiviral Therapy
- Antibacterial Drug Treatment

Severe and Critical Cases Treatment
In addition to the general treatment:
- Oxygen treatment: non-invasive and invasive methods
- Circulation Support
- Renal failure and renal replacement therapy
- Recovered patient’s plasma therapy
- Blood purification
- Immunotherapy
- Other treatments: Traditional Chinese Medicine, Pregnancy Termination/Cesarean delivery for severe cases of pregnant women, psychological counseling, etc.


###Hospital release and precautions

Patients can be considered for discharge when:
- The body temperature has returned to normal for more than 3 days
- Major improvement of respiratory symptoms
- Pulmonary imaging that shows improvement in acute exudative lesions
- Two negative test results

After being released from the hospital the patient should remain isolated for 14 days, wear a mask, reduce contact with other people, stay in a well-ventilated room, follow the recommended hygienic rules.

###When will we have a Vaccine for C19?

Not known.

About 35 companies and academic institutions are racing to create such a vaccine, at least four of which already have candidates they have been testing in animals. The first of these – produced by Boston-based biotech firm Moderna – will enter human trials imminently. The [first US clinical trial of a Covid-19 vaccine](https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/first-us-covid-19-vaccine-trial-moderna/) candidate, which is Moderna’s mRNA-1273, has started at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI) in Seattle. Some pharma companies say it can take up to one year, other researchers mentioned six to eight weeks. The exact timeline is still unknown.

The process of making a safe and efficient vaccine has multiple stages and can take up to a decade or more until it is approved. And even after there will be an approved one, the process of manufacturing and distributing it to everyone who needs it can be long and challenging.
